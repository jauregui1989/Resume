<h1>Questions and Presentation - Final Project Part 2</h1>
<h2>TASK DETAILS - PART 1</h2>

<p><b>What was your previous knowledge of HTML/CSS/Javascript?</b></p>


<p>Before taking this class I had heard about HTML and Java but never knew they were related, on the other hand I never heard about CCS. I had some idea about HTML and was exposed to the coding but never really paid attention. For java I've heard about but never knew or understood what it was.</p>


<p><b>Did you use a template or did you build your portfolio from scratch?</b></p>

<p>I used the template provided by the teacher since I was overwhelmed to start from scratch. I figured it was less stressful to use the template and just modify to my like</p>

<p><b>What was your most challenging part of your portfolio (ie, the template, artifacts, CSS, etc.)</b></p>

<p>Putting everything together was the biggest challenge and keeping it all the same flow and structure but if I have to choose I would say the first page the index, it was the first page where I had to figure things out and then applied to the rest of the pages. After the index things were easier but lengthy.</p>

<p><b>How taking this class changed your view on Web Development? </b></p>

<p>Taking this class really opened my eyes. Now i'm able to read, recognize, write and modified HTML,CCS and Java. HTML is the easiest but combining CCS and Java is where I struggle. One of my take aways from this class is that web design is time consuming and lengthy which I didnt enjoy a lot but I loved seeing a website coming alive from my coding.</p>

<p><b>What would you recommend to future students taking this class?</b></p>

<p>to be patient and to really spend time watching videos if you are a visual learner, watching someone actually use the code will help a lot. Regardless of how time consuming it is to write the code it is fun, exciting and fullfilling to see your own website coming to life!</p>
