  <p>Did you know that in most latino countries children usually get 4 names? that is the case with me.</p>
<p>I was born in Caracas Venezuela but I lived in many different countries one of them being USA. I moved here when I was 14 and grew up in Belleveu Washingtion</p>
  <p>In my past life I was a teacher for 7 years but now I work in the tech world as a Risk and Fraud Analyst</p>
  <p>I have a degree in Early Childhood Education but that degree is of not much use in the tech world, for that reason im persuing a Analytics Certificate at Belleveu College</p>
